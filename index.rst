`mcdust` Documentation
=======================

| `mcdust` is a code to model the growth and evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks.

| `mcdust` is a 2D (r-z) code that simulates the vertical and radial evolution and growth of dust. The dust growth is implemented using a Monte Carlo approach.

| The details are `mcdust` are presented in Drazkowksa et al. (2013) & Vaikundaraman et al. (in prep).

| Here we outline the basic setup and usage of the code and some ways in which one can make use of the features of the code.
